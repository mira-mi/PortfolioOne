# FisherYatesShuffle

This was created in 1938 and was used for biological, medical and agricultural statistic research.
It gives a finite sequence.
It is truly random and unbaised.

In my project though, I made a simple thing that shuffles strings or words of feelings and emotions.
So, I was able to play with an external file and shuffle it in essence. 

It reminded me of the random number generator learned from Intro to programming I. It really does show a lot that I thought I understood.
So, it was reminscient of more random, random number generator and it really does feel like it.

I heavily enjoyed playing with external files and random again.
I did like using some simple words to shuffle instead of numbers because I wanted to try something else
