# AssignmentOne-CodeExamples
This is the first code assignment, and here we learned about big o notation
#Linear notation
In that one we showed two parts that convey the same thing
> the first one shows an array with one loop, that one loop prints out 5 items
-It's pretty basic with the array having the numbers 1-5
-The code has a pretty standard loop
>the second one is a random number generator 
-it has a basic amount that it could choose from
-it has seven numbers it could use and print out
#Quadratic notation
>the first one has nested loops to print out something 
-It uses a random array to print things out
-It has one array and it will print out random pairs
>the second one has nested loops as well
-It has two arrays to print out multiple things
-It's kinda like coordinates
#Constant notation
>the first one has a a write line condition 
-it uses an array and it's one step
-prints out one item
>the second deals with odd numbers
-It does one thing as a constant 
-It has one the capability to print out 1 or 10001 possibilties
