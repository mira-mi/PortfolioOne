# PortfolioOne

This is my first portfolio for this class. I am in Algorithms this year and I have data structures, fisher yates, and big O notation.
This code has been cleaned and taken care of to show my understanding of each.

The code for each algorithm has been included in this portfolio

Big O notation is composed of:
- a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity
It is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
It is referred to as the order of the function. 

Fisher-Yates Shuffle is compsosed of:
 - an algorithm for generating random permutation of an infinite sequence in plain terms, the algorithm shuffles the sequence.
It produces an unbiased permutation, which means that each set is likely.

Data structures is composed of:
  - is a named location that can be used to store and organize data
 It is seen as a collection of steps to solve a particular problem
 
 That it is all that is involved with this portfolio.
