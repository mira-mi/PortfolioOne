# Algorithms Portfolio
Hi, my name is Maya and I made this portfolio for a class. This is my first portfolio for coding so please forgive me if I'm not good at doing this.

This is my first portfolio for this class. I am in Algorithms this year and I have data structures, fisher yates, and big O notation.
This code has been cleaned and taken care of to show my understanding of each.

The code for each algorithm has been included in this portfolio

# Big O notation is composed of:
- a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity
It is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
It is referred to as the order of the function.

# Fisher-Yates Shuffle is compsosed of:
 - an algorithm for generating random permutation of an infinite sequence in plain terms, the algorithm shuffles the sequence.
It produces an unbiased permutation, which means that each set is likely.

# Data structures is composed of:
  - is a named location that can be used to store and organize data
 It is seen as a collection of steps to solve a particular problem

 # AssignV:Sorting
 - this project was about sorting data sets with multiple algorithms. Here I made multiple algorithms and gave each one a timer to see how long each one took
 and there was provided in a summary in the end
 - Each algorithm was comes with best and worst case as well as a description and puesdo code to see how each one fuctions before it is coded in c#
 - this portfolio consists of bubble, insertion, heap, quick, selection, and merge sort.

 That it is all that is involved with this portfolio.
