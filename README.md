# Algorithms Portfolio
Hi, my name is Maya and I made this portfolio for a class. This is my first portfolio for coding so please forgive me if I'm not good at doing this.

This is my first portfolio for this class. I am in Algorithms this year and I have data structures, fisher yates, big O notation, different types of searching 
as well as sorting, and tree nodes. All the code for this is in c#, that is my main language this year.
This code has been cleaned and taken care of to show my understanding of each.

The code for each algorithm has been included in this portfolio

## Big O notation is composed of:
- a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity
It is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
It is referred to as the order of the function. 


## Fisher-Yates Shuffle is compsosed of:
 - an algorithm for generating random permutation of an infinite sequence in plain terms, the algorithm shuffles the sequence.
It produces an unbiased permutation, which means that each set is likely.


## Data structures is composed of:
  - is a named location that can be used to store and organize data
 It is seen as a collection of steps to solve a particular problem
 
 
 ## AssignV:Sorting
 - this project was about sorting data sets with multiple algorithms. Here I made multiple algorithms and gave each one a timer to see how long each one took
 and there was provided in a summary in the end
 - Each algorithm was comes with best and worst case as well as a description and puesdo code to see how each one fuctions before it is coded in c#
 - this portfolio consists of bubble, insertion, heap, quick, selection, and merge sort.


## SearchingAlo: Searching
- this project is more about learning searching algorithms and how they work. I had to also give these a timer to see how long each one took and which and each one
contains a summary at the end of all this
- Each one like the sorting one comes with descriptions of each one including best and worst case as well as puesdocode
- this portfolio contains linear, binary, and interpolation searching.


## AssignTrees: Trees
- this project is to show how to use tree nodes using the dictionary function in c#. I had to also show a sorting algorithm of my choice in this one. I chose bubble
sorting for this one.

## Update
- the names in this portfolio have been changed to better suit the fact that each folder had a weird name when dealing with them. Hope this makes it easier to go 
through and see the data clearly.
