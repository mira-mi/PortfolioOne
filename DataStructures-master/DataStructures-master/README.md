# DataStructures
In this weeks lesson, we learned about certain data structures
For my project, I used comparisons between hashtables and arrays as well as stacks and queues

For the comparisons, they all have different names or strange phrases to get the point across but they all contain the same amount
I have drawn conclusions which are commented in
Hashtables are good for multiple data sets while arrays are good singular data sets.
Stacks are good for removing the first while queues are good for removing the last.

I have spoken about using it for more complex ones but this is a good start for the first time doing it.
I truly feel like the hands on approach is better for learning algorithms
